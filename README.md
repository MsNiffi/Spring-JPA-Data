## Background

This project is created for the purpose of creating backend API and endpoints with a database using Hibernate and
Spring.
The assignment was to be completed through pair programing.

## Install

Gradle will automatically initialize itself and download necessary dependencies the first time the wrapper is run. No
explicit installation necessary.

## Usage

For Linux/macOS users, open a terminal and run:

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

For Windows users, use `gradlew.bat` instead of `gradlew` in PowerShell.

To utilize the methods in the AppRunner simply remove the // from each method and run the application.
